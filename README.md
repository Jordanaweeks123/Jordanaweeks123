- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jordan Weeks (@Jordanaweeks123)
- I come from an education in Physics and Math from the University of Texas at Austin. I've since focused my efforts towards coding and software engineering because I love the tangibility and progression of technical work. 
- My background and strengths are in mathematical/data analysis, physical problem solving, and python, but there's no reason to stop at what my education pushed me to learn. 
- I enjoy sharing my passions, and I've made it my mission to utilize my coding skillset to teach people about things I love while nurturing my own personal career growth.

I hope you enjoy my github! Please email me with questions or comments at jordanweeks123.jw@gmail.com, I always enjoy talking about future projects and prospects.
